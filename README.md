### Project name
GatorChat

### Project description
GatorChat is a messaging app specifically designed for University of Florida students. It offers a variety of themed forum pages, starting with forums for each course at the University of Florida where students can connect and communicate with their classmates about class-specific topics such as assignments, professors, projects and exams. Each course at the University of Florida will have its own forum, allowing students to easily find and join discussions relevant to them. The app also plans to expand to other themes such as academics, sports, food, Gainesville, etc, allowing students to discuss and share information pertaining to different topics of interest. GatorChat is an efficient tool for students to focus on their studies and make the most out of their university experience by connecting with peers and sharing information.
